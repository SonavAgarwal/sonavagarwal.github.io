            <h1>Experience</h1>
            <p>An avid coder, I can code in Scratch, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C, C#, and Python. After starting on Scratch in 5th grade, I looked for more ways to learn. In middle school, I led the coding club, which was mainly on about Scratch. Then, in high school, I joined numerous clubs and took coding classes to expand my skills. I was introduced to C and Python in the class, and I continued learning them at home. Below, you will find some information about my projects.</p>

            <h1>SVKS Coding Camp</h1>
            <img src = "Images/SvksCode.jpg" class = "bigTopicalImg">
            <p>For Silicon Valley Korean School, I organized a free, one week long coding camp with 6 other people. There was a Scratch and Java session, and I was the lead for the Scratch session. I oversaw and helped create the curriculum for the Scratch session, with getting young children interested in coding in mind. The feedback we recieved was overwhelmingly positive, and we will likely hold more camps in the future.</p>
